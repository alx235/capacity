dynamic lib- load to memory one time?
static - load to memory every time

const and typedef - internal link
inline must be defined in each translation unit when it declared
external C/{} - link C compatible code, have no influence on call's semantics, but have on type safe, etc.
compiler need .h, linker libs
preprocessor make macroreplace and insert from include sorces
compiler check declaration rule
linker check other rule and multiple different translation unit
each declaration (can be separate) must have only one definiton

ODR: two def mean one if:
-located in another transl unit
-identical by lexeme
-has same mean(typedef) in each transl unit

exit() call only static var destr
abort() ignore all

ะก++ no virtual constructor

defenition constant in header file cause effective compilator code

<const_cast>/mutable(const mod member) - guess for what)

s=q or s(q) call member-by-member copy of all bit from one to another

s==q? maybe some bit compare?

extern "C" - only linker rule. Why? because diiferent lang (comp) have diff way of location memory,
 procc stack,  etc.. So you say link "it" in C rule (for compatibility) - NOT use for diff.
 C++ compilers!!!

nonlocal static var call constr in def order in bound of translation unit to guaranted out use static flag (kkeep state) - first flag use strategy or ...static int x = 0;... - init first time control flow cross defenition, after call main(...) counter, nonlocal init before, in all case destructor call after main(..) except some abnormal program complete
temporary object can't link with non-const reference? (maybe because this type object can't be lvalue?, and const ref is not obliged to check this condition)

FORBIDDEN overload: ::, ., .*, ?;, sizeof, typeid.

Unar/binar oper can be overloaded with non-static member(no,1 argc) or global funct (1, 2 argc), local have no precedent this case, unar firs arg CAN'T be POD type

Overload operatos: =,[],(),-> only non-static member;

friend mod => function get access only in hide scope of class (don't understand nothing...)

IMPLICIT CONVERSION NOT ALLOWED WITH NON_CONST REF FUNC ARGS
POSTFIX OVERLOAD operator have signature with int arg, it's value has no mean..., it's only signature and all.
