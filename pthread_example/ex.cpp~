//pthread_cond_t is "signal and wait"
//wake up waiting thread by signal,waiting thread must wait until some condition become true (producer/consumer)
//waiting(pthread_cond_wait) case must be rare
//usefull in producer/consumer problem and semaphore, only one non-abstract example i have founded is bounded queue.
//semaphore - limit count of threads have access(by wait(limit--)) to share resource, if limit reached (0) next will 	"wait" until one of accessed finish(post(limit++)), ++ current number and send "wake up" signal to one "waiting"...
//not found any "not study" example of semaphore...
//"waiting" implemented (in POSIX) by futex with WAIT flag and null timeout (futex is syscall) - thread "sleep"
//until futex with WAKE flag call.
//advantage is use timeout if access to share resourse can lock accessed thread(s) or share must have timeout
//Performance of pthread_cond_wait lesser mutex (POSIX)
//Performance highly depend on platform/CPU instruction
